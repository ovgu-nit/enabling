title: "IM HERE – Interaction Model for Human Effort-Based Robot Engagement"
description: We present IM HERE, a formal effort-based framework for modeling engagement across human–robot, human–human, and robot–robot interaction. It captures relational dynamics, supports group interactions, and offers a modular implementation for real-world robotic systems.

## IM HERE – Interaction Model for Human Effort-Based Robot Engagement

**Engagement** is a core requirement for natural and adaptive human–robot interaction (HRI), but remains challenging to generalize across contexts.  
Our **IM HERE** framework introduces a **formal, generalizable model** based on the idea that **engagement can be quantified through the observable and interpretable effort between entities**.

The model represents **bilateral relationships** between any two entities—human, robot, or object—by continuously tracking:
- **Focus** — the allocation of cognitive or perceptual resources.
- **Effort** — measurable signals (e.g., gaze, speech, gestures) indicating engagement.

Each interaction is mapped to one of **four fundamental states**:
`Passive`, `Requested`, `Buildup`, and `Engaged`.

### Key features:
- **Bridging perspectives:** Integrates both **subjective** (self-perceived) and **objective** (externally observed) viewpoints.
- **Miscommunication handling:** Detects and accounts for mismatched engagement states.
- **Norm compliance:** Supports socially appropriate interaction behaviors.
- **Scalable:** Applies to **individual** and **multi-party** scenarios, incorporating **F-formations** to handle group dynamics.
- **Generalizable:** Works across human–human, human–robot, and robot–robot contexts.
- **Implementation-ready:** Includes a **modular open-source simulator** for testing and visualizing engagement in real-time HRI scenarios.

The IM HERE framework offers a **clear, computationally grounded approach** for autonomous systems to reason about their role in dynamic interactions—facilitating natural, safe, and socially aligned behaviors.
